            <h2>To my MiniBoss, Megan</h2>
            <p>I know I'm not the best with words but I'll do my best. These last 6 months have been super spethal and I find myself falling deeper and deeper in love with you everyday. Every second spent with you these last 6 months have been a blessing, you really know how to make saying goodbye on a Sunday the most difficult part of our relationship. From the playful bullying to our terrible cooking, every moment spent with you is a moment I wouldn't trade for anything (not even for the answers to the secrets of the universe) and I can't wait to see what the future holds for us as we go through the challenges of life together...</p>
            <p>Always yours, <br>Big Boss</p>
